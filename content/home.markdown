The Pep Band plays at all men's Division I hockey games in the Frank Ritter Arena, as well as other athletic and non-athletic events.

The Pep Band always welcomes new members.  We meet Tuesdays from 5:45 - 6:45 in
the music room under the Student Alumni Union.

Feel free to stop by during practice or contact us at [ritpepband@gmail.com](mailto:ritpepband@gmail.com)
