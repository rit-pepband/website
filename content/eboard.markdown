#E-Board 2011

## Conductor | Jimmy McNatt  
<img class='right' src='images/eboard/2011/jimmy.jpg'/>
Year: 4  
Major: Applied Networking/System Administration  
Minor: Music & Technology  
Instrument: Tenor Saxophone  
Hometown: Boiling Springs, PA  
  
Jimmy McNatt is a rocker turned Pep Band man. Jimmy not only can jam on guitar and bass
guitar (and not just the rock band ones), but he's the pep band's personal epic sax man, playing both
tenor and alto saxophone, and even clarinet. He will be leading the band with an iron fist, and an iPad,
which goes so well with his stylish conductor hat! But yes, an iron fist - he has been dabbling in artificial
limbs and actually works for Stark Industries and helps Tony Stark’s with his Iron Man suit. Give him
some good music and some technology to play with, and he'll make every Pep Band event an exciting
one by blasting through walls (and the ice rink glass) with Stark’s latest invention.
When not with the best band in the land, Jimmy tends to live where he works in the GCCIS
honors lab, also known as Girls Cannot Come In-Side. He technically lives in Pep Band House, but
like any good computer nerd, Jimmy knows home is where the technology is, as well as a couch and
Honors stocked refrigerators. Here is where Jimmy conducts his work secretly (obviously not so secretly
anymore) on Stark’s trinkets and machines. It is rumored that Jimmy stashed the Iron Man prototype
somewhere in GCCIS, although he denies all accusations of this.

## Secretary | Kaity Moranz  
<img class='right' src='images/eboard/2011/kaity.jpg'/>
Year: 2  
Major: Environmental Science  
Instrument: Clarinet  
Hometown: Rochester, New York  
  
Kaity has been playing her clarinet since 4th grade. Living in Bearchester, Kaity's life was
doomed to be filled with bears. After a tragic event with a trombone, a tuba playing bear, and a snare
drum, she started plotting her revenge. She founded the Clarinet Triad of Evil, where she has cleverly
made firearms that still function as clarinets. The benefit to creating this weapon/instrument is that even
if ammo has been depleted, the Triad can use their skills to musically assault the ears of their opponents.
The Clarinet Triad of Evil is trying to create an army to show the world how mighty and powerful they truly
are, no matter the volume conceived at times. To help build this army Kaity steals men's hats and inserts
a computer chip. When the time comes, this chip will send messages through the brain to help the Triads
plot.
When Kaity is not plotting evil she is exploring the wetlands. She can identify sludge, plant life,
and animal life (especially bears) with the greatest of ease. She is always in search of a rare species-
Pokemon. She just has to catch 'em all. She loves Pokemon so much that she has dedicated herself to
the well being and protection of this rare species. When she's not playing with the pep band or in class,
she dedicates a lot of her time to devising new ways to protect Pokemon from harm, right now they are
being guarded by Clarinet (bazooka) playing Bears.

## Treasurer | Dave Stoffel  
<img class='right' src='images/eboard/2011/dave.jpg'/>
Year: 3  
Major: Accounting  
Minor: Law and Finance  
Instrument: Alto Saxophone  
Hometown: Spencerport, NY  
  
No matter the comical effect that happens when you see Dave with an alto saxophone, don’t dare
ask if he plays Basketball. Yes, he is tall, but he is definitely all about music. A musician through and
through, he has been playing the saxophone for 11 years. Jazz, Rock, Classical and of course Pep are
on Dave’s hit list. That’s right, a hit list, because Dave belongs to the Secret Society of Assassins (SSA).
These assassins investigate their targets and try to find each resonant frequency of the different organs.
Using this frequency, musical notes can be played that cause the organs to vibrate and eventually
explode, making it look like the victims spontaneously combusted. He has a lot of practice after years of
saxophoning and studying these frequencies. After every kill Dave takes one of the targets shot glasses
as a trophy. He now has a collection of the victims shot glasses on his mantle place to remind him of his
killing success with music.
When he is not eliminating targets, Dave pursues his Accounting major as well as a minor in Law
and Finance. Dave hopes to turn the SSA into a legitimate business, or at least turn a bigger profit while
avoiding the authorities. Dave is currently negotiating with Jimmy to use SSA to protect Stark-related
equipment from thieves, GDD majors, and bears.

## Vice President | Kelly Fidler
<img class='right' src='images/eboard/2011/kelly.jpg'/>
Year: 2  
Major: Hospitality and Service Managment  
Minor: Music  
Instrument: Tenor Saxophone  
Hometown: Pine Grove, PA  
  
Kelly is a unique person among us in more ways than her magical personality.
She was rejected from Hogwarts, because they said her type was already well represented by the Weasley’s. She also applied to Durmstrang Institute, but was dismissed to to her lack of burliness and well manliness not to mention being muggle born. That left Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, who told her that due to her red hair they could not accept her, though she matched their other requirements . With this news she concluded that she would have to explore magic elsewhere. So, Kelly Fidler decided to leave her home in Pine Grove, PA (according to Google, it exists), and join us at RIT. She uses her magic to supply us with exceptional saxophone music for the pep band, and of course, the sexy hockey players. Kelly believes these RIT hockey players are magical warriors in training. She can be seen at hockey games attempting to communicate to each player through the magic of her saxophone. Contrary to the popular belief, she cannot play the fiddle.
Kelly is also an avid sports fan when not practicing magic. Although usually found on a volleyball or basketball court, Kelly is also a closet racquetball player, and hopes to turn pro shortly after graduation. Even though she is magical, she doesn’t play quidditch, as she finds it to be too flaunting and dangerous. However, she does race griffins and hunts dragons for fun, and exercises to keep her skills sharp.

## Vice President | Matt Fico  
<img class='right' src='images/eboard/2011/fico.jpg'/>
Year: 4  
Major: Game Design  
Instrument: Tenor Saxophone  
Hometown: Dover, NJ  
Mr. Matt Fico, our returning Vice President, is one of the amazing people whose instrument is
half his size but his volume is louder than all the other woodwinds combined. Matt is from munchkinland,
where it is said he worked for The Wizard creating video games. Through these video games, the
munchkins bop witches on the head with houses, though this is yet to be proven in full. There is currently
a lack of evidence of a yellow brick road, lollipops, twisters or falling houses. However, there have been
many Dunkin’ Donut boxes in the trash found by the pep band investigators. The investigation is still
underway.
Upon graduation, Matt plans to become a superhero- Quailman. He will watch over RIT,
protecting it from all evildoers, more specifically falling houses and witches with green faces. He will then
design an interactive video game based on his Quailman adventures. It will require dressing up with
your underwear outside of your pants like all good superheros and wannabes. There is also rumor of a
autobiography about his work in OZ, giving the inside scope to what it was like to meet Dorothy, and his
affair with Galinda the good (apparently in more than one way) witch.

## President | Gabi Potts
<img class='right' src='images/eboard/2011/gabi.jpg'/>
Year: 3  
Major: Industrial Design  
Instrument: Tenor Saxophone  
Hometown: Danville, Vermont  
  
Gabi Potts hails from the land of teddy bears, ice cream and snow. Unsatisfied with Vermont (who wouldn't be?), she came to RIT to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering. After learning she couldn't pursue her future plans, she changed majors and is now working towards an Industrial Design degree. Gabi brings with her 11 years of saxophone playing experience, and amazing ways to deck out instruments and Pep Band in general. Like all Vermonters (Vermontians?), Gabi's most prized possession is her teddy bear collection. She scours the globe adding every stuffed animal she comes across. She is, after all, the single biggest reason why Build-A-Bear turns a profit. When she isn't looking for new teddy bears to add to her ginormous collection, she can be found swimming or camping, two of her favorite pastimes.
Gabi hopes to one day combine the knowledge gained from her major with her love of teddy bears. She hopes to gain a Product Development role within Build-A-Bear and create a line of bears that children can teach. Her goal is to that these teach-a-bears will learn her many passions such as swimming, camping, and playing many instruments. No word yet on when this plan will come into effect or how long it will take to eventually turn into Skynet.
