Year: 3  
Major: Industrial Design  
Instrument: Tenor Saxophone  
Hometown: Danville, Vermont  
Gabi Potts hails from the land of teddy bears, ice cream and snow. Unsatisfied with Vermont (who wouldn't be?), she came to RIT to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering. After learning she couldn't pursue her future plans, she changed majors and is now working towards an Industrial Design degree. Gabi brings with her 11 years of saxophone playing experience, and amazing ways to deck out instruments and Pep Band in general. Like all Vermonters (Vermontians?), Gabi's most prized possession is her teddy bear collection. She scours the globe adding every stuffed animal she comes across. She is, after all, the single biggest reason why Build-A-Bear turns a profit. When she isn't looking for new teddy bears to add to her ginormous collection, she can be found swimming or camping, two of her favorite pastimes.
Gabi hopes to one day combine the knowledge gained from her major with her love of teddy bears. She hopes to gain a Product Development role within Build-A-Bear and create a line of bears that children can teach. Her goal is to that these teach-a-bears will learn her many passions such as swimming, camping, and playing many instruments. No word yet on when this plan will come into effect or how long it will take to eventually turn into Skynet.

Major: Hospitality and Service Managment

Hometown: Pine Grove, PA  
  
Kelly is a unique person among us in more ways than her magical personality.
She was rejected from Hogwarts, because they said her type was already well represented by the Weasley’s. She also applied to Durmstrang Institute, but was dismissed to to her lack of burliness and well manliness not to mention being muggle born. That left Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, who told her that due to her red hair they could not accept her, though she matched their other requirements . With this news she concluded that she would have to explore magic elsewhere. So, Kelly Fidler decided to leave her home in Pine Grove, PA (according to Google, it exists), and join us at RIT. She uses her magic to supply us with exceptional saxophone music for the pep band, and of course, the sexy hockey players. Kelly believes these RIT hockey players are magical warriors in training. She can be seen at hockey games attempting to communicate to each player through the magic of her saxophone. Contrary to the popular belief, she cannot play the fiddle.
Kelly is also an avid sports fan when not practicing magic. Although usually found on a volleyball or basketball court, Kelly is also a closet racquetball player, and hopes to turn pro shortly after graduation. Even though she is magical, she doesn’t play quidditch, as she finds it to be too flaunting and dangerous. However, she does race griffins and hunts dragons for fun, and exercises to keep her skills sharp.
